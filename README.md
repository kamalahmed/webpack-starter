You need to have Node and NPM installed on your computer. You can install them from nodejs website.

# how to use it
---
Step 1: Clone the repo and go to the root of the direcotry in your terminal
Step 2: Run `npm install` // to install all the required packages
Step 3: Run `npm run build` // to build the assets from the src directory

Now you can make any changes on your src folder and once done you can build your script with `npm run build` command. 
Later we will add a watcher command then you will not have to build your scripts everytime you make a change in inside your src folder.
